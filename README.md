# CS235UnitTests
Unit tests for my version of the CS 235 class. Use these to do your development before you run your code against the testbed.

Special thanks to the student of my fall 2018 CS 235 class for being the pioneers in using and debugging these tests. Your eyes-on-the-code has been greatly appreciated and will be a blessing to those who follow.
